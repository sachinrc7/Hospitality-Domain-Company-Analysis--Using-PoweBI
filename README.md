# Hospitality-Domain-Company-Analysis--Using-PoweBI

The goal of the AtliQ Hospitality Revenue Analysis project is to address the decrease in market share and revenue that AtliQ Grands, a renowned hospitality company with multiple five-star hotels in India, has been facing. To accomplish this, the company plans to hire a third-party service provider who will utilize historical data to provide insights and assist in the recovery of market share and revenue.

To gather the necessary data, five CSV files (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings) and a metadata file (meta_data_hospitality.txt) containing column information was collected.

In the hospitality industry, weekends (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and weekdays (Sunday to Thursday) are significant operational considerations. URN represents the number of rooms utilized by customers, while BRN encompasses utilized rooms, cancellations, and no-shows. RevPar is calculated as the Total Revenue divided by the Total Rooms Available for sale, while Occupancy is derived by dividing the Total Rooms Occupied by the Total Rooms Available. ADR represents the average rate at which rooms are sold and is calculated as the Total Rooms Revenue divided by the Number of Rooms sold.

The project will primarily focus on analyzing several key metrics, including RevPar (Revenue per Available Room), Occupancy, DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Night), Revenue, ADR (Average Daily Rate), URN (Utilized Room Nights), and BRN (Booked Room Nights). These metrics will provide valuable insights into the company's revenue realization percentage, help identify any channel-specific issues, and support informed decision-making for future planning.

The solution design involves creating a dashboard that will showcase the analyzed data and insights. The dashboard will also incorporate a channel-level breakdown to facilitate the identification of any issues at that level.
